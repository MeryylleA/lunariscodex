# Lunaris Codex - Project Dependencies
# ------------------------------------
# This file lists the Python packages required to run the core
# Lunaris Codex project (training and inference).
#
# Recommended Python version: 3.10.x or 3.11.x
#
# To install:
#   pip install --upgrade pip
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# For NVIDIA GPU support, ensure a compatible CUDA toolkit is installed. The torch
# version listed here will attempt to install with CUDA support. For specific
# CUDA versions, consider installing PyTorch manually from pytorch.org.

# --- Core Deep Learning & ML Ecosystem ---
torch>=2.1.0                # PyTorch 2.1+ is recommended.
transformers>=4.38.0        # For loading tokenizers (AutoTokenizer).
datasets>=2.14.0            # Required for certain tokenizer/data utilities from the HF ecosystem.

# --- Data Handling & Utilities ---
numpy>=1.23.0               # For memory-mapped arrays and numerical operations.
tqdm>=4.60.0                # For clean progress bars during training loops.
psutil>=5.9.0               # For memory usage monitoring in the inference script.

# --- Tokenizer Backends & Model Serialization ---
# Required by many modern tokenizers (e.g., StarCoder, Llama).
sentencepiece>=0.1.98
# For secure and fast tensor serialization (standard in the Hugging Face ecosystem).
safetensors>=0.4.0

# --- CLI Enhancement & User Experience ---
# For the rich, interactive command-line interface in `inference.py`.
rich>=13.0.0

# --- Optional for Performance (Manual Install) ---
# For optimized attention on compatible NVIDIA GPUs, install manually.
# This is NOT a required dependency and is only needed for performance optimization.
# >> pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
#
# flash-attn

# --- Development & Testing (For Contributors) ---
# These packages are not required for running the project, but are used
# for development, linting, and testing. See CONTRIBUTING.md for details.
#
# pytest>=7.0.0
# pytest-cov>=4.0.0
# black>=23.0.0
# flake8>=6.0.0
