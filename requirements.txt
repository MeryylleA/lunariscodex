# Lunaris Codex - Core Dependencies
# ==============================================================================
#
# This file lists the direct dependencies for the Lunaris Codex project.
# It uses "compatible release" version specifiers (~=) to allow for minor bug
# fixes and security patches while maintaining compatibility.
#
# For 100% reproducible builds, see the `requirements.lock` file, which can be
# generated with `pip freeze > requirements.lock` in a working environment.
#
# NOTE: PyTorch should be installed separately according to your hardware (CUDA/CPU/MPS).
#       Visit https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ for the correct command.
#       The version specified here is for reference.
#

# --- Core ML & Torch Ecosystem ---
# Pinned to 2.7.x to ensure stability with CUDA/Triton versions.
torch~=2.7.1
triton~=3.3.1  # Often tied to a specific torch version, good to keep pinned.

# --- Hugging Face Ecosystem ---
# For data loading and tokenization.
datasets~=4.0
tokenizers~=0.21
huggingface-hub~=0.34
safetensors~=0.5

# --- Utilities ---
# For configuration, progress bars, etc.
PyYAML~=6.0
tqdm~=4.67
numpy~=2.1   # Usually a dependency of torch/datasets, but good to specify.
pandas~=2.3  # If used in any data analysis/prep scripts.

# --- Experiment Tracking ---
# For logging metrics and results.
wandb~=0.21
