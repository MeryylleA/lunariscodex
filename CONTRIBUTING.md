## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Lunaris Codex Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug in the training or inference scripts, please check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/MeryylleA/lunariscodex/issues) to see if it has already been reported. If not, please open a new issue and provide as much detail as possible, including:
- A clear, descriptive title.
- Steps to reproduce the bug.
- Full error messages and stack traces.
- Your environment (Python/PyTorch version, OS, CUDA version).

### Suggesting Enhancements
If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to the existing code, please open an issue to start a discussion. We value clear proposals that outline the potential benefits to the project.

### Submitting Pull Requests
When you're ready to contribute code:

1.  **Fork the repository** and create a new branch from `main`.
2.  **Make your changes.** Ensure your code adheres to the styleguides below.
3.  **Add or update tests** if you are adding new functionality.
4.  **Write clear commit messages.**
5.  **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch of the Lunaris Codex repository.
    *   Provide a clear description of the changes.
    *   Link to any relevant issues (e.g., "Closes #123").
    *   The project maintainer (@MeryylleA) will review your PR.

## Development Setup

1.  Clone your fork of the repository.
2.  Create and activate a Python virtual environment (Python 3.10+ recommended).
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate 
    ```
3.  Install the required dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  To run tests and linters, you will need additional packages. You can install them manually:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest pytest-cov black flake8
    ```
5.  Run tests locally to ensure your changes haven't introduced regressions:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages
-   Use the present tense (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature").
-   We recommend using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) prefixes (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`).
    *Example:* `feat: Add ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler to train.py`

### Python Code Style
-   Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
-   Format your code with [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) to maintain a consistent style.
-   Use a linter like [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) to catch common errors.
-   Add type hints to your Python code.

## Community

-   Join our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/MeryylleA/lunariscodex/discussions) for questions and ideas.
-   Be respectful and adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Thank you for helping make Lunaris Codex a better tool for everyone!
