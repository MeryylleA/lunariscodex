# Lunaris Codex

![Lunaris Codex](lunaris-codex.jpg)

Welcome to the repository of **Lunaris Codex**, a 100% Brazilian Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on programming. Built from scratch, Lunaris Codex is a Transformer-based model designed to generate and interpret code in multiple languages, such as Python, JavaScript, Java, and Rust, with a special emphasis on Python.

## Summary

- **Objective**: Develop an efficient AI tool for programmers to assist with code generation, interpretation, and technical problem-solving.
- **Technology**: Transformer architecture optimized with Alibi (replacing UOP for better efficiency), trained on 617 million tokens, with plans to expand to 2-4 billion tokens.
- **Datasets**: The Stack V2, FineWeb, Hugging Face Datasets, and other technical code-focused datasets, prioritizing Python.
- **Startup**: Developed by Moon Cloud Services, a company dedicated to innovation in AI and neural networks.

## Technologies Used

- **Framework**: Built using PyTorch for model development and training.
- **Libraries**: Leveraging Hugging Face ecosystem, including Transformers for architecture and tokenization, and Datasets for high-quality data curation.
- **Programming**: Primarily coded in Python, with support for generating code in multiple languages.
- **Hardware**: Trained on 4 NVIDIA H100 GPUs for high-performance computing.
- **Infrastructure**: Hosted on OVHcloud servers with $10,000 in credits for scalable processing.

## Project Details

- **Model Size**: Between 160 million and 260 million parameters, balancing efficiency and capability.
- **Training Goals**: Expanding the dataset to 2-4 billion tokens for a full training run, enhancing accuracy and versatility.
- **Features**: Code generation, interpretation, debugging assistance, and optimization of programming tasks.
- **Open Source**: The source code will be released on GitHub under an open-source license, with restrictions to prevent unauthorized modifications.

## Status

Lunaris Codex is under active development and will be available soon as an open-source project on this GitHub repository. Stay tuned for updates!
